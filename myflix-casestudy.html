    <h1 class="case-study_title">Case study - <span>myFlix web application</span></h1>

    <h3 class="headers">Overview</h3>
    <p>myFlix is a movie library, full-stack web application built with the MERN stack. The
      app allows users once registered and logged in to view the list of movies present in
      the database, create a list of their favourite movies and view information about the
      different directors and genres. Finally users can also decide to deregister from the
      application.</p>

    <h3 class="headers">Purpose and Context</h3>
    <p>The project was part of my careerfoundry web development bootcamp. The aim was to
      demonstrate my ability to create a full stack application using JavaScript
      programming language. Also, myFlix application was the perfect project for myself
      because of my passion for movies. Therefore I was very enthusiastic to develop the
      app and showcase it to fellow developers and film enthusiasts.</p>
    <h3 class="headers">Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of the project was to build a full-stack application from scratch using
      the
      MERN stack to showcase my skills to potential employers. The project started by
      building
      the database and back-end of the application with the use of MongoDB, Node.js and
      Express. The client-side on the other hand was developed using React.js. </p>

    <h2 class="approach-header">Approach</h2>
    <h3 class="headers">Back-end</h3>
    <p>First, I used Node.js and Express to create a RESTful API that would interact with
      the
      movies database, which was created using a non-relational database (MongoDB). The
      database contains two collections: movies, which contains all movies and their
      relative
      information (synopsis, genre and director); users, which contains the list of all
      registered users and their personal information.</p>
    <p>The API can be accessed via HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE). In order to
      interact
      with the database and be able to store and retrieve data, I made use of CRUD methods
      (mainly using Create, Read, Update, and Delete). Finally the data returned from the
      database is in a JSON format.</p>

    <div class="postman">
      <img src="./img/Postman-Screenshot.png" class="postman__portrait" alt="postman screenshot" width="60%"
        height="60%">
      <p>To test the application in the development phase, I used Postman. For authentication
        and
        authorization, I used HTTP and JWT tokens. The API was then hosted on Heroku.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="headers">Front-end</h3>

    <p>Regarding the front-end of the application, it is a single page application built
      with React.js. The application provides the user with several views that include a
      login view, a registration view, a main view (displays all movies in the database),
      a movie view (displays information about a single movie), a genre view (displays
      information about a specific genre), a director view (displays information about a
      specific director) and a profile view (displays personal information about the
      logged in user, that can also be updated).</p>

      height="30%">
    <h3 class="headers">Challenges</h3>
    <p>This was definitely one of my favourite projects and most challenging too. Before
      working on this project, I had not worked on projects involving building the
      back-end of an application, so it was very rewarding building my own API and
      database at the same time. Also I got pretty good at using the terminal.</p>
    <p>In regards to the front-end, it was my first time working with React and to be honest
      it took me a while to comprehend how the state and props of a component function and
      how to manipulate them, but thankfully after getting some practice and watching some
      useful tutorials online, I managed to complete the app successfully.</p>
    <h3 class="headers">Duration</h3>
    <p>It took a little over two month to complete the entire application.</p>
